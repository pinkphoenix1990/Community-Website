# Gaymers Community Website

The purpose of this repository is to give members of the community a chance to contribute their web developing abilities with ease and confidence.

## Design Philosophy

Going forward, we will be attempting to design the website in multiple tiers, starting with conceptualizing, brainstorming, and general mission. Then, we will create the foundation and build upon it as the website develops.

We should always be interested in ensuring that the website is as 'future-proof' as plausible by using modern language styles and updated libraries, packages, and management systems.

## Why is Our Own Website Necessary?

There are a number of benefits to using a third-party company to provide a website. Places like Enjin work really well, and they are designed specifically with gamers in mind. Unfortunately, it comes at a steep cost. Outside of monetary requirements, using a 'packaged' website provider means extraordinary limitations in what the community can provide.

For example, the previously mention company works on a financially-funded access system. Free users get the bare minimum, with advertisements being placed on the website. Advanced users will get more features, but they are limited in number and have restricted utility. Ultimate members have the most features, for the greatest financial investment. Yet, even then the website will not give the user access to necessary customization of webpages, stylesheets, scripts, databases, or nearly anything required to provide an excellent website.

## The Game Plan

###Brainstorm:
   What is it that the community could use?
   Can the community benefit from any particular feature?
   Will features make gaming easier?

   What software is needed?
